<h1>RouteX 🚍  </h1>
<h3>Real-Time Bus Tracking & Route Discovery Android App</h3>
RouteX is an Android application that enables real-time tracking of buses and helps passengers find buses between a selected source and destination. Drivers share live GPS data, and passengers can view accurate bus locations directly on Google Maps.

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
In many cities, passengers lack reliable information about bus locations and routes, leading to uncertainty and time loss. Existing solutions either lack real-time accuracy or proper route-based search.

<h3>Solution</h3>
RouteX solves this by allowing drivers to broadcast their live location and enabling passengers to:
<ul>
<li>Track buses in real time using bus numbers</li>
<li>Search for buses between a specific source and destination</li>
<li>View live bus movement on Google Maps</li>
All data synchronization is handled in real time using Firebase.
</ul>

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Real-time bus location shared by drivers</li>
  <li>Live bus tracking on Google Maps</li>
  <li>Search buses using a specific Bus Number</li>
  <li>Find buses between a selected Source and Destination</li>
  <li>Role-based flow for Drivers and Passengers</li>
  <li>Firebase-powered real-time updates</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tech Stack</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Frontend: </b>Android (Kotlin)</li>
  <li><b>Development Tool: </b>Android Studio</li>
  <li><b>Backend & Database: </b>Firebase Realtime Database, Firebase Authentication</li>
  <li><b>Cloud Services: </b>Google Cloud Platform</li>
  <li><b>Maps & Location: </b>Google Maps API</li>
</ul>

<h3>App Workflow</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Driver → Shares live GPS location → Firebase Realtime Database</li>
  <li>Passenger → Fetches bus data → Displays live location on Google Maps</li>
</ul>

<h3>Future Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Display intermediate stops (via points) for each bus route  </li>
  <li>Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) calculation based on live location  </li>
</ul>
